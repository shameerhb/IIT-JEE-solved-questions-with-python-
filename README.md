# Physics Reasoning Archive

This repository contains a curated collection of physics problems
solved with clear reasoning, structured explanations, and
LaTeX-formatted derivations.

The goal is to document **how** to think through physics problems —
showing the logical steps, reasoning strategy, interpretation of
results, and optional computational verification.

## 🔍 What Each Problem Contains

Every solved problem includes:

- **Problem statement** rewritten in clean mathematical form  
- **Step-by-step reasoning** written in natural language  
- **Derivations** using proper LaTeX equations  
- **Physical interpretation** explaining what the result means  
- **Optional Python code** (matplotlib/numpy) for:
  - plotting motion graphs  
  - verifying equations  
  - visualizing concepts  

This structure demonstrates strong analytical thinking and clarity
— valuable in both academic and AI-evaluation contexts.

## 💡 Purpose of the Archive

The archive is meant to serve as:

- A reference for conceptual understanding  
- A reasoning-focused physics notebook  
- A demonstration of structured problem-solving ability  
- A foundation for AI training/prompt-evaluation portfolios  
- Clean examples of physics explanations for technical roles  

The focus is not on memorizing formulas, but on **interpreting motion,
deriving relations, and explaining why results make sense**.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

Currently includes problems from:

- Classical Mechanics  
- Kinematics  
- Dynamics  
- Graph interpretation  
- Energy methods  

More topics will be added as the archive grows.

## 🧪 Tools Used

- **LaTeX** for mathematical clarity  
- **Python** (NumPy + Matplotlib) for simulations and graphing  
- **Markdown/Jupyter** for clean documentation

## 📌 About Problem Sources

The problems are inspired by classical physics problem sets.
All solutions are rewritten in original form with independent
explanations and derivations.
